Analysis

1. Capomulin was the only drug that had a beneficial response to treatmenet from day 0 to day 45 with a 19% decrease in tumor volume. While taking Infubinol, Ketapril or a placebo, the percentage in tumor volume change increased; Infubinol by 46%, placebo by 51% and Ketapril which exceded growth further than the mice taking the placebo by 57%.

2. Taking a placbo vs. taking Ketapril will have a similar effecr on metastatic spread of the tumor. With Capomulin having the least rate of tumor spread followed by Infubinol. 

3. Looking at survival rate of mice from day 0 to day 45, we can conclude that Capomulin has the highest survival rate in mice with almost 85% survival rate at 45 days. while Infubinol, Ketapril and placebo have low survival rates below 50%.

4. We can conclude that although Ketapril may stop the tumor from spreading to other parts of the body, it will adversly speed the rate of tumor volume vs taking a placebo.
